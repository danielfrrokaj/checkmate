    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: March 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Focus is a Chrome extension designed to help users manage their tasks and track time efficiently. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>CheckMate does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data. All tasks and timer settings are stored locally on the user's device using Chrome's local storage API (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>).</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>CheckMate does not share any user data with third parties, external services, or remote servers. All data remains on the user's device.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally within the browser, CheckMate does not transmit any information over the internet, reducing privacy risks. Users have full control over their stored data and can clear it at any time by removing the extension or clearing browser storage.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at <strong>dfrrokaj1@outlook.com</strong>.</p>
